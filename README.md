# Drain Log
Drain log, star date... (no, it's not that kind of log!)

### Overview
This log tracks daily accumulation of serosanguineous fluid from a [JP Drain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson-Pratt_drain">JP Drain) following a parotidectomy to remove tissue from the parotid, submandibular, and lymph node for biopsy. The drain was cleaned with alcohol each time, and the wound kept uncovered and clean. Daily output of [less than 25mL](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229371/) is considered appropriate for drain removal, and it seems logical that the timing of this event would vary based on the procedure. This log aims to help pinpoint this event for a single case.

### Example use case
A demo is available [here](http://www.vbmis.com/bmi/project/drainlog). Ideally, this kind of interactive functionality could be integrated into a hospital's patient portal (with a method to input the data) and allow both the physician and patient to track a wound's healing process.

### Modifying the code
The graphic and table are rendered from the [tab separated text file](data.tsv). You are free to modify this file and distribute as you please. The code can be dropped into any folder on a web server and will work.
