20150706	25.0	42	compression half day
20150707	25.0	85	compression half day, drainage is increasing :(
20150708	25.0	95	first day of good compression around the face. This strategy worked (with the drain pressure released) until dinner, and it poured out to totally soak the dressing and padding, and the best solution was to restore the drain suction. Thus, the amount of drainage recorded is increased, but still an under-estimation. It was not feasible to *not* empty the drain, which was the original plan. I will try to maintain the compression with the drain open if possible, but will introduce suction in the case of extensive draining from the wound itself.
20150709	25.0	55	The attempt last night that soaked the compression dressing in saliva led to a bad outcome for today - despite washing it smelled SO bad that I couldn't wear it at all. I tried using different versions of ACE wraps and bandages from the drug store but it didn't work. Further, having had taken off the suction, the tube was consistently leaking (and not working) and I had to increase the suction with considerable "milking" to restore its function. The output for today was somewhat darker, slightly yellow, and there was blood in the tube at times. I also noticed that my left gland feels more reactive at onset of food or drink - akin to when you eat a sour candy, but with pretty much anything. I would hypothesize that the increase in drainage is somehow related to that. My conclusions are that removing suction is a bad idea (it leaks from the hole, and we essentially just lose our ability to track output). My strategy for tomorrow will be to apply compression with suction on.
20150710	25.0	75	The compression was washed and dried properly, and I was able to wear it for about 4 hours of the work day (whenever I didn't need to be talking). The drainage amount is about the same, however it is clearly a cloudy yellow color in contrast to the clear (possibly thinner) saliva that was present previously. On average, both night time and daily drainage is ~15, likely because I don't eat/chew. Dinner drainage is between 40-50mL, and it always starts with dripping from the wound itself until I milk the drain and increase suction. I am thinking that the drain needs to come out this coming week regardless of output because it is consistently leaking.
20150711	25.0	83	The drainage continues to increase, even during the day when I am only minimally drinking. Today there was a bit of pain, slightly more swelling, and still a cloudy yellow, and so I am concerned about a developing infection. I only could bear wearing the compression for about an hour because it pushes on the tube in my cheek, and it hurts. The drain continues to leak, and I press gauze around the drain opening and milk the tube until the suction is restored. I am keeping the scar hydrated with vaseline.
20150712	25.0	65	Today was much better - decreased drainage and only some leaking early in the day, and no pain. I didn't use the dressing.
20150713	25.0	30	30mL today!!
